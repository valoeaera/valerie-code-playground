# README

## What is the repository for?

This repository is a place for me to house my personal code projects and write-ups.
As of 13th April 2023, it contains:

- `playground`: A REACT-based site built with Vite v4 for me to play around with various CSS/HTML/JS challenges
- `val-knowledgebase`: A documentation site built with Docusaurus. It contains writeups for labs I've completed and other code knowledge/hacks I can't trust myself to remember.
- `weird-js`: A JS site built with Vite v3 for me to follow along to the Weird JS video series.

## Dependencies

- Node v19+
- NPM v9+
